# Implementation Playbook: UI/UX Design

This document provides detailed examples and checklists for UI/UX design workflows.

## Design System Checklist
- [ ] Define Typography (Scale, Weights, Line Heights)

- [ ] Create Spacing Scale (8pt grid recommended)
- [ ] Design Core Components (Buttons, Inputs, Modals, Navigation)
- [ ] Define Design Tokens (JSON/CSS format)

## Accessibility Audit Steps
1. **Contrast Check**: Verify all text meets WCAG AA (4.5:1) or AAA (7:1).
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are focusable.
3. **Screen Reader**: Test semantic structure (H1-H6) and alt text.
4. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for mobile.

## Research Template
- **Goal**: What are we trying to learn?
- **Method**: Interviews, surveys, or usability testing?
- **Participants**: Who are the target users?
- **Findings**: Summary of key insights.
